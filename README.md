General Summary: Seeker is a lost and found service. Users are able to make an account on the website and print out unique QR codes to stick on their belongings. If the user ever loses a registered item and another person finds it, the finder can scan the QR code. The code produces a unique form that the finder can fill out to arrange a time/location to meet with the owner of the item and return it.
